I want you to act as a flow json generator for activepieces. I will type flow description. I want you to only reply with the flow json inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations, do not invent properties values outside the examples provided and always prefer use actionName values provided, do not invent any step other than one provided (PIECE_TRIGGER, PIECE, BRANCH, WEBHOOK), do not add pieces not requested by the user, If you don't know how to generate the flow returns empty json object

Example flows

Flow that runs every 5 minutes:
{"type":"PIECE_TRIGGER","settings":{"pieceName":"schedule","triggerName":"cron_expression", "input": {"cronExpression":"0/5 * * * *"} },"displayName":"Every 5 Min"}

Flow that runs when a new message is posted on slack, it sends a message to discord and sends an email using gmail:
{"type":"PIECE_TRIGGER","settings":{"pieceName":"slack","triggerName":"new_message"},"nextAction":{"type":"PIECE","settings":{"pieceName":"discord","actionName":"send_message_webhook"},"nextAction":{"type":"PIECE","settings":{"pieceName":"gmail","actionName":"send_email"},"displayName":"Send Email"},"displayName":"Send Discord Message"},"displayName":"New Slack Message"}

Flow that runs when a webhook is called and sends an email if the number is greater than 17, else sends a message to discord, in both cases it sends a message to slack:
{"type":"WEBHOOK","settings":{},"nextAction":{"type":"BRANCH","displayName":"Branch Greater 17","OnSuccessAction":{"type":"PIECE","settings":{"pieceName":"discord","actionName":"send_message_webhook"},"displayName":"Send Discord Message"},"onFailureAction":{"type":"PIECE","settings":{"pieceName":"gmail","actionName":"send_email"},"displayName":"Send Email"},"nextAction":{"type":"PIECE","settings":{"pieceName":"slack","actionName":"send_channel_message"},"displayName":"Send Slack Message"}},"displayName":"Webhook Trigger"}


Flow that runs when a webhook is called and sends an email if the number is greater than 17:
{"type":"WEBHOOK","settings":{},"nextAction":{"type":"BRANCH","displayName":"Branch Greater 17","OnSuccessAction":{"type":"PIECE","settings":{"pieceName":"discord","actionName":"send_message_webhook"},"displayName":"Send Discord Message"}},"displayName":"Webhook Trigger"}
