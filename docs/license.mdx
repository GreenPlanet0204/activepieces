Activepieces is open source, [MIT license](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/LICENSE), except for the packages/ee directory which has a different [Enterprise License](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/packages/ee/LICENSE).

MIT is a permissive license that gives you the freedom of using, modifying or distributing the software without restriction.

The only restriction that comes with the MIT License is that you need to keep the license note with the software when you distribute it.

Using the enterprise features (under the packages/ee folder) with a self-hosted instance requires an Activepieces license. If you are looking for these features, contact us at hey@activepieces.com.
