With Activepieces, you use a **Trigger** and **Pieces** to build a **Flow** then you **Publish** these flows to get them running.

We'll go through these terms quickly:

## Triggers and Pieces

**Triggers** control **how often** or **when** the automation will run. Flows always start with a Trigger.

**Pieces** are elements that perform actions. They either communicate with external services (Apps) or process data (Helpers).

The following screen shows:
- To the left: a Schedule Trigger and a Slack Piece.
- To the right: The list of Pieces you can use add to the flow. This list shows when you click on the "+" in the flow.

## Flows

A Flow is a sequence of Trigger and Pieces. In the previous example, the Schedule trigger and the Slack piece together make a flow.

## Publishing

Flows are organized in Collections. In the following screenshot, you can see **Flow 1** and **Flow 2** together in the **My Automation** collection.

Once you are ready to start your automation, click on **Publish**. This will save the new version of the collection and enable it.
