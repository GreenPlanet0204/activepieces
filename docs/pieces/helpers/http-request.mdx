## Overview

The HTTP Request piece is used to send HTTP requests to external endpoint. This piece is one of the most powerful generic purpose pieces, it lets you communicate with external services regardless of having specialized pieces built for them.

This is how the settings of this piece will look when you add it to your flow:

## Use cases

This piece is used for one thing: Sending HTTP requests to external endpoints. This can be any of the following:

- A 3rd party software that doesn't exist as an app on Activepieces, or whose app doesn't have the functionality you're looking for.

- An internal service you maintain by yourself and would like to send data to. For example: if you'd like to hit an endpoint on your server to store data in your own database, or initiate a process on your server.


## Instructions

As you see in the screenshot of the step settings above, you can configure the HTTP piece as follows:

### Method

This is the method of the request you are sending. The available methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT` and `DELETE`.

The method should follow the endpoint's implementation, if the endpoint expects a `GET` request, you will send it so.

### URL

This is the URL of the endpoint you'd like to hit.

### Headers

You can add additional headers to the request by defining header names and values. You can attach multiple headers to the request.

### Body

This is the data sent with the request. This is usually used with the `POST` or `PUT` methods.

The body input lets you enter raw data without an expected formatting. If you'd like to send JSON data with the request, check out the example below.

## Examples

### Sending a POST request with JSON data

It's common to send requests with JSON data in their bodies, to do so with the HTTP Request piece, you'll do the following configurations:

**Method:**<br/>
`POST`

**URL:**<br/>
`https://www.example.com/api/users`

**Headers:**<br/>
Name: `Content-Type`<br/>
Value: `application/json`

**Body:**
```json
{
    "key_1": "value_1",
    "key_2": "value_2"
}
```
