Each time you add a step to a flow, you choose a piece to represent this step.

There are 3 main **types of pieces** that you can use as steps, as follows:

| Piece Type | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| App | Performs an action on a 3rd party app | Send a Slack message |
| Flow Control | Controls the logic of the next step of the flow | Loop through array items |
| Helper | Executes an advanced operation without writing code | Parse a CSV file into an array |

You can find all pieces under the Apps, Helpers and Flow Controls sections.

If you are looking for a specific piece and can't find it, visit our [Custom Pieces](./custom-pieces) page to figure out the best way around it.
