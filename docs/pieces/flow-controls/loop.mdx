## Overview

The Loop piece helps you loop through a collection of items and execute specific actions for each iteration.

You can only select a single step output as the collection to loop through.

From within the loop you can make use of two properties: 
- Index (an index refering to current loop iteration which starts with 1).
- Item  (current loop item from passed collection)

If the item property is an object and you need a nested property within it you can click "Custom Path" and fill in the path to the property you need.

<Note> We are going to keep working on improving the experience to reach properties within "Item" </Note>
